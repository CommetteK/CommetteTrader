To set up your solanacontractlauncher folder with the necessary dependencies for deploying Solana smart contracts, you'll need to follow these steps in the terminal:

Navigate to the solanacontractlauncher folder:
cd path/to/CommetteTrader/solanacontractlauncher

Initialize a new project (if not already initialized):
If you haven't already initialized the folder as a Node.js project, you can do so with:
npm init -y
This command will create a package.json file in your solanacontractlauncher folder.

Install the necessary dependencies:
You'll need to install the following dependencies:
@solana/web3.js: The JavaScript library for interacting with Solana.
@project-serum/anchor: Anchor framework for developing Solana smart contracts.
typescript: If you want to use TypeScript.
@types/node: TypeScript type definitions for Node.js.
To install these dependencies, run:

npm install @solana/web3.js @project-serum/anchor typescript @types/node
Initialize TypeScript (if using TypeScript):

Install Solana CLI. Found in this document https://docs.solanalabs.com/cli/install

Set up Anchor for Solana:

Anchor is a framework for Solana that simplifies the development of smart contracts. To initialize an Anchor project, run:
anchor init
This command will create an Anchor project structure within your solanacontractlauncher folder.

If you prefer to structure your Solana smart contracts with Anchor, it will handle the boilerplate code and testing framework for you.
Build and deploy contracts (using Anchor):
To build your smart contracts, you can run:
anchor build
To deploy your contracts to the Solana blockchain, use:
anchor deploy
This setup provides you with all the tools needed to develop, build, and deploy Solana smart contracts within the solanacontractlauncher folder of your CommetteTrader project.
