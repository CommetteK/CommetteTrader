To set up your solanacontractlauncher folder with the necessary dependencies for deploying Solana smart contracts, you'll need to follow these steps in the terminal:

Navigate to the solanacontractlauncher folder:
cd path/to/CommetteTrader/solanacontractlauncher

Initialize a new project (if not already initialized):
If you haven't already initialized the folder as a Node.js project, you can do so with:
npm init -y
This command will create a package.json file in your solanacontractlauncher folder.

Install the necessary dependencies:
You'll need to install the following dependencies:
@solana/web3.js: The JavaScript library for interacting with Solana.
@project-serum/anchor: Anchor framework for developing Solana smart contracts.
typescript: If you want to use TypeScript.
@types/node: TypeScript type definitions for Node.js.
To install these dependencies, run:

npm install @solana/web3.js @project-serum/anchor typescript @types/node
Initialize TypeScript (if using TypeScript):

Install Solana CLI. Found in this document https://docs.solanalabs.com/cli/install

Set up Anchor for Solana:

Anchor is a framework for Solana that simplifies the development of smart contracts. To initialize an Anchor project, run:
anchor init
This command will create an Anchor project structure within your solanacontractlauncher folder.

If you prefer to structure your Solana smart contracts with Anchor, it will handle the boilerplate code and testing framework for you.
Build and deploy contracts (using Anchor):
To build your smart contracts, you can run:
anchor build
To deploy your contracts to the Solana blockchain, use:
anchor deploy
This setup provides you with all the tools needed to develop, build, and deploy Solana smart contracts within the solanacontractlauncher folder of your CommetteTrader project.


SIMPLIFIED SETUP EXLCUDING ANCHORE

To fix your issue with installing and running Solana, follow these steps:

Install Solana CLI v1.18.18 using the command:

sh -c "$(curl -sSfL https://release.solana.com/v1.18.18/install)"
Ensure the Solana installation path is included in your environment's PATH:

Next:

export PATH="$HOME/.local/share/solana/install/active_release/bin:$PATH"
Verify the installation:

NEXT:

solana --version


If that works, proceed with building your Solana program using cargo build-sbf. This ensures compatibility with the Solana toolchain.

Set up the Solana environment: Make sure your Solana CLI is connected to the correct network:

solana config set --url https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com

Build the program: Navigate to your program folder, and build the smart contract using:

cargo build-sbf


Deploy the program: Once the build is successful, you can deploy it with:

solana program deploy ./target/deploy/master_wallet_nft.so
Replace master_wallet_nft.so with the actual path to your .so file if it's different.

This command will upload your program to the Solana blockchain. Make sure your wallet has sufficient SOL for the deployment fees.
